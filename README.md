🌿 AgroAI: Smart Plant & Pest Detection System
AgroAI is a comprehensive deep learning application designed to empower farmers and researchers. It integrates two powerful AI engines to identify plant diseases and agricultural pests in real-time, providing actionable insights for crop management.
🚀 Features
Dual Detection Engines:
Plant Disease Detection: Uses a Deep Learning model (TensorFlow) to identify 38+ types of crop diseases from leaf images.
Pest Recognition: Uses a State-of-the-Art Vision Transformer (ViT) (PyTorch/Timm) to identify 40 different types of agricultural pests.
Actionable Insights: Provides detailed descriptions, chemical treatment recommendations (pesticides), and preventive measures for every detection.
Professional UI/UX: A clean, responsive interface built with Streamlit, featuring a custom-styled footer with a professional agricultural landscape background.
